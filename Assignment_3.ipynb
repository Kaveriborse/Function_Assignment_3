    "Abstraction: Functions provide a higher level of abstraction. We can encapsulate complex operations within a function and use a simple interface to interact with it. This makes code more readable and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability and Maintainability: Well-structured functions improve the readability of code. When a function has a clear purpose and a descriptive name, it's easier for other developers to understand its functionality. This leads to better maintenance and easier debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Organization: Functions help organize code by grouping related tasks together. This makes it easier to manage larger programs and navigate through codebase.\n",

    "Encapsulation: Functions can hide the implementation details of a certain task, exposing only the necessary input/output or behavior. This improves security and reduces the risk of unintended side effects.\n",

    "Team Collaboration: When multiple developers are working on a project, well-designed functions with clear interfaces make collaboration smoother. Each developer can work on different functions independently.\n",
